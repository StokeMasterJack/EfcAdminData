		<![CDATA[1002680.description=These lights turn on when the engine switch is turned to the "ON" position (vehicles without Smart Key System) or the “ENGINE START STOP” switch is turned to IGNITION ON mode (vehicles with Smart Key System) to indicate that a system check is being performed. They will turn off after the engine is started, or after a few seconds. There may be a malfunction in a system if a light does not come on, or if the lights do not turn off. Have the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer.]]>
