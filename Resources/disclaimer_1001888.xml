		<![CDATA[1001888.description=There are actually two batteries on hybrid vehicles, the traction battery (usually referred to simply as the "battery") and the auxiliary 12-volt battery, which powers accessories and the car's computer, similar to a conventional vehicle. The traction battery in Prius uses Nickel-Metal-Hydride (NiMH) chemistry, and has been made more compact, powerful and durable due to our 5-year experience in designing and manufacturing hybrid vehicles.]]>
