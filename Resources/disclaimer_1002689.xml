		<![CDATA[1002689.description=These lights turn on when the engine switch is turned to IGNITION ON mode to indicate that a system check is being performed. They will turn off after the engine is started, or after a few seconds. There may be a malfunction in the system if the lights do not come on, or do not turn off. Have the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer.]]>
