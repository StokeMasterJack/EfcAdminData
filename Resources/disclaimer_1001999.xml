		<![CDATA[1001999.description=Lane Keep Assist is designed to read the lane markers of certain roads and apply slight torque to the steering wheel to help keep the car in the center of the lane. If the vehicle approaches the outer limits of its lane, the Lane Departure Warning feature sounds a warning tone and applies slight torque to the steering wheel to notify the driver that corrective action may be required. These features are not a collision-avoidance system and are not a substitute for safe and attentive driving. System effectiveness depends on many factors. See your <i>Ownerâ€™s Manual</i> for further information. ]]>
