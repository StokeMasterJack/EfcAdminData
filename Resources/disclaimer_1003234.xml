Once the engine switch is turned to the ON or START position, the buzzer sounds for 6 seconds. The buzzer sounds once if the driver's or front passenger's seatbelt is unfastened when the vehicle reaches a speed of 12mph (20km/h). Then, if the seatbelt is still unfastened after 30 seconds elapse, the buzzer will sound intermittently for approximately 10 seconds, followed by a different tone for approximately 20 more seconds.]]>
