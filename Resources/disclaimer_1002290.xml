		<![CDATA[1002290.description=Additional equipment required. Please discuss your towing requirements with either your Toyota dealer or a professional supplier of towing equipment before you equip your Toyota vehicle for towing. Before towing, confirm your vehicle has any necessary additional equipment (including a properly installed tow hitch). Your vehicle is designed primarily as a passenger-and-load carrying vehicle. Towing a trailer will have an adverse effect on handling, performance, braking, durability and driving economy (fuel consumption, etc.).]]>
