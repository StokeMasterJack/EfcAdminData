		<![CDATA[1002669.description=These lights turn on when the engine switch is turned to the ON position to indicate that a system check is being performed. They will turn off after the engine is started, or after a few seconds. There may be a malfunction in a system if a light does not come on, or if the lights do not turn off. If this occurs, have the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer.]]>
