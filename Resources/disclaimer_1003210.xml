		<![CDATA[1003210.description=Seatbelt warning buzzer: The seatbelt warning buzzer sounds to alert the driver and/or front passenger that their seatbelts are not fastened. If the driver’s seatbelt is not fastened, the buzzer will sound for 6 seconds once the “POWER” switch is turned to ON mode. If the vehicle reaches a speed of 12 mph (20 km/h), the buzzer will sound once. If the seatbelt is still unfastened after 30 seconds, the buzzer will sound intermittently for 10 seconds. Then, if the seatbelt is still unfastened, the buzzer will sound in a different tone for 20 more seconds.]]>
