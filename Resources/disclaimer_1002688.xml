		<![CDATA[1002688.description=These lights turn on when the engine switch is turned to the “ON” position (vehicles without a Smart Key System) or IGNITION ON mode (vehicles with a Smart Key System), to indicate that a system check is being performed. They will turn off after the engine is started, or after a few seconds. There may be a malfunction in a system if the lights do not come on, or turn off. Have the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer.]]>
