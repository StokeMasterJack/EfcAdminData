		<![CDATA[1001837.description=Standard Miles: The total allowable standard mileage is calculated by dividing the number of months in the term by 12 and multiplying this amount by 15,000. For example, the total allowable miles on a standard lease with a 36-month term is calculated as follows: 36-month term divided by 12 = 3 years; 3 years multiplied by 15,000 = 45,000. A charge is assessed for any mileage driven that exceeds this limit. Low Miles: The total allowable miles under TFSâ€™ Low Mileage Lease Program is calculated by dividing the number of months in the term by 12 and multiplying this amount by 12,000. For example, the total allowable miles under a TFS Low Mileage Lease with a 36-month term is calculated as follows: 36-month term divided by 12 = 3 years; 3 years multiplied by 12,000 is 36,000. A charge is assessed for any mileage driven that exceeds this limit.]]>
