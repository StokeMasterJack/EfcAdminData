That’s what you get when you add a TRD performance air intake system to your FJ:<br />•Takes cool air from behind and below the headlights (rather than hot engine compartment air) and supplies this cooler, denser air to the engine to increase power and improve cooling<br />•Designed to work with the factory ECU and emissions system<br />•Includes reusable TRD high-flow air filter with a custom-calibrated filter service gauge that visually indicates when the filter needs servicing<br />•Dyno-tested to deliver an increase in horsepower and torque for superior acceleration and greater pulling power<br />•Emissions legal in all 50 states<br /><br /><em>The TRD performance air intake is to be sold as dealer-installed or over-the-counter options after the retail sale of the vehicle. The performance air intake may not be sold to the customer at the same time as the new vehicle and may not be financed together with the new vehicle. Please see the TRD catalog, visit www.trdusa.com or call 800-688-5912 for a complete list of TRD products and warranty information. Emission-legal for aftermarket sale via C.A.R.B.
