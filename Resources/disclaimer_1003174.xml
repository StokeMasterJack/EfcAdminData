		<![CDATA[1003174.description=These lights turn on when the engine switch is turned to the “ON” position (vehicles without a smart key system) or the “POWER” switch is turned to ON mode (vehicles with a smart key system) to indicate that a system check is being performed. They will turn off after the hybrid system is on, or after a few seconds. There may be a malfunction in a system if a light does not come on, or if the lights do not turn off. Have the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer.]]>
