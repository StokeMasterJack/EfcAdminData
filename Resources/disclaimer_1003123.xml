		<![CDATA[1003123.description=These lights turn on when the “ENGINE START STOP” switch is turned to IGNITION ON mode (vehicles with a smart key system) or the engine switch is turned to the “ON” position (vehicles without a smart key system) to indicate that a system check is being performed. They will turn off after the engine is started, or after a few seconds. There may be a malfunction in a system if a light does not come on, or if the lights do not turn off. Have the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer.]]>
