		<![CDATA[1002668.description=These lights turn on when the engine switch is turned to ON position to indicate that a system check is being performed. They will turn off after the hybrid system is started, or after a few seconds. There may be a malfunction in a system if the lights do not come on, or if the lights do not turn off. Have the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer.]]>
