		<![CDATA[1003168.description=These lights turn on when the “POWER” switch is turned to ON mode to indicate that a system check is being performed. They will turn off after the hybrid system is on, or after a few seconds. There may be a malfunction in a system if a light does not come on, or if the lights do not turn off. Have the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer.]]>
