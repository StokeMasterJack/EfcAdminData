		<![CDATA[1001825.description=Generally, the more down payment, the more favorable the deal. A down payment can lower your monthly payment, lower the percent of your monthly income used for a vehicle payment, increase your equity in the vehicle, and allow you to select a shorter term and pay off the vehicle more quickly. If you have weak credit, a larger down payment can improve the deal]]>
