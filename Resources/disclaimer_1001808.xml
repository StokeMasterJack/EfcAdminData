		<![CDATA[1001808.description=Location services must be activated on smartphone for vehicle finder to function. The location shown will be the last known location at time of vehicle ignition off. If your vehicle's ignition is turned off in an area without GPS coverage (e.g., underground parking structure), the application may not be able to update the GPS location and previous last known location will be shown. Customers have the option of opting out of the Vehicle Finder Application if so desired through the Entune<sup>&reg;</sup> App Suite account management website at www.myentune.com.]]>
