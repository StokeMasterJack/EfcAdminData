		<![CDATA[1002664.description=Crawl Control is designed for driving difficult terrain at low speeds. It assists the driver by controlling acceleration and braking, allowing the driver to focus on steering. Toyota 4x4s are designed to meet most off-road driving requirements, but off-roading is inherently dangerous. Abusive use may result in bodily harm or vehicle damage. Toyota encourages responsible operation to protect you, your vehicle and the environment. Seatbelts should be worn at all times.]]>
