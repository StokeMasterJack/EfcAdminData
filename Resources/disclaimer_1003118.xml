		<![CDATA[1003118.description=Vehicles without a Smart Key System The driver's seatbelt buzzer sounds to alert the driver that his or her seatbelt is not fastened. Once the engine switch is turned to the "ON" position, the buzzer sounds for 6 seconds. If the vehicle reaches a speed of 12 mph (20 km/h), the buzzer sounds once. If the seatbelt is still unfastened after 30 seconds, the buzzer will sound intermittently for 10 seconds. Then, if the seatbelt is still unfastened, the buzzer will sound in a different tone for 20 more seconds.]]>
